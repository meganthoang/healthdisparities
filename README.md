# The Evolution of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health

This repository contains the analysis code for my Honors Undergraduate Thesis on "The Evolution of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Outcomes"

> Health disparities between different racial/ethnic groups in the United States are substantial. When reviewed across an extensive body of literature, these disparities have been demonstrated to persist even when socioeconomic status, geographic region, health conditions, treatment methods, and patient access-related variables are controlled for. This ultimately leads to higher mortality rates among minority patients, making disparities in health a highly prevalent issue. However, the literature suggests that while racial and ethnic disparities in health have been widely examined, research documenting the evolution of these changes over time is lacking. This motivates the research questions: (1) How has the impact of racial biases on disparities in health outcomes evolved over the past decade?; (2) To what extent do race and ethnicity impact variation in health outcomes?; and (3) To what extent are race and ethnicity correlated with the socioeconomic gradient in health?; Last, (4) How present were these disparities when looking at outcomes related to the COVID-19 Pandemic? This thesis aims to address these questions through a two-part empirical analysis using publicly available data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


## Analysis Files included in this repository:

### NHIS
> The first component aims to address research questions (1) through (3) – How has the impact of racial biases on disparities in health outcomes evolved over the past decade?; To what extent do race and ethnicity impact variation in health outcomes?; and To what extent are race and ethnicity correlated with the socioeconomic gradient in health? – by conducting a set of regressions examining the relationship between patient characteristic variables and reported health, using a dataset from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This data was obtained through selecting a data extract from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) database, found [here.](https://healthsurveys.ipums.org/)

### CDC
> The second component aims to address research question (4) – How present were these disparities when looking at outcomes related to the COVID-19 Pandemic?  To directly examine the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on health throughout the pandemic, this component of the empirical analysis was conducted using data from the COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found [here.](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf)
